This folder contains public assets for your Minecraft portfolio.

TO ADD YOUR HERO BACKGROUND:
1. Take a screenshot from your Minecraft world (overworld scene)
2. Save it as "hero-background.png" in this folder
3. Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
4. The image will automatically appear as the hero background

The app will show a fallback gradient until you add your image.
